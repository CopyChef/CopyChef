Approach
Copy cat recipe sites are abundant and we wanted to give users of our API a quick and simple way access those recipes since most of them are found after going through quite a clicks and taps. We began with creating our user stories as a team:

Diane: A suburban mom with 5 kids who keep her busy. She likes to stick to healthier foods for her family which is sometimes hard considering how picky her kids are about what they eat. One way she knows her kids are more than willing to eat what is on the table is to eat out at their favorite restaurants, however that can get pricey with a large family. She wants a quick and simple way to be able to search for her kids favorite restaurants and find those recipes her kids get excited about so she can make them in her own kitchen.  

Bachelorette Betty: A working professional who likes to unwind by cooking, she likes to eat at popular local restaurants but cant always find someone to go with, also that gets expensive. After a long day at work she would like nothing better than to put on her apron and cook her own dinner and make it exciting by choosing a recipe from a nice restaurant. 

Takeaways: Be able to search by restaurant
busy users need easy, quick options.
