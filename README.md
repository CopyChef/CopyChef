### Approach
Copy cat recipe sites are abundant and we wanted to give users of our API a quick and simple way access those recipes since most of them are found after going through too many clicks and taps. We wanted the user to be able to search for recipes by restaurant, recipe, food type, and tags associated with each recipe. We divided up the work based on our strengths. We talked out the wireframes and got to work, Stephen and Lidia started on Express, Backbone, and MongoDB while that was complete Nick and Adam worked on creating styling and templates for views. We also each contributed to our sample data by each contributing some of the recipes we wanted to see on our api.
Front-end and back-end came together on day 3 and we started figuring out what needed to be done to make the integration complete. 


### Technologies Used
 
* Express
* Backbone
* Mongo DB
* Jquery
* Handlebars
* Passport
* Materialize

We wanted to use backbone as a challenge to ourselves 
Why We Used MaterializeCSS
Adam built out wireframes into static html/css pages. He has done other sites with pure CSS from scratch without libraries/frameworks like Materialize or Bootstrap and wanted experience with a library of default stylings. The project timeframe required speedy development which a library could provide. Significant customizations were made to the defaults in our own styles.css file. Nick did very significant front end work as well including styling and worked out a style guide with Adam.

We We Didn’t Use LESS
Adam researched the LESS CSS pre-processor. Adding the extra step of compiling and the new learning required for both Nick and Adam didn’t seem worth it given that our styles.css is only 150 lines long.



### User Stories

Diane: A suburban mom with 5 kids who keep her busy. She likes to stick to healthier foods for her family which is sometimes hard considering how picky her kids are about what they eat. One way she knows her kids are more than willing to eat what is on the table is to eat out at their favorite restaurants, however that can get pricey with a large family. She wants a quick and simple way to be able to search for her kids favorite restaurants and find those recipes her kids get excited about so she can make them in her own kitchen.  

Bachelorette Betty: A working professional who likes to unwind by cooking, she likes to eat at popular local restaurants but cant always find someone to go with, also that gets expensive. After a long day at work she would like nothing better than to put on her apron and cook her own dinner and make it exciting by choosing a recipe from a nice restaurant. 

Takeaways: Be able to search by restaurant
busy users need easy, quick options.


### Wireframes
Adam led on wireframes, user tested them with an avid online recipe user (his wife), refined them, shared them with the team, refined them a bit more.
